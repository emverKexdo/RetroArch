PLC simulator software can be very useful for beginners who want to get familiar with the basics of PLC programming, as well as for experienced engineers who want to troubleshoot and optimize their existing PLC programs. However, not all PLC simulator software are created equal. Some are more realistic, user-friendly, and feature-rich than others.
  
So how do you find the best PLC simulator software free download full version? Here are some tips to help you choose the right one for your needs:
  
- Check the compatibility. Make sure the PLC simulator software is compatible with your operating system and your preferred PLC programming language. Some PLC simulator software only support Windows, while others can run on Mac or Linux. Some PLC simulator software only support ladder logic, while others can also handle function block diagram, structured text, or instruction list.
- Check the functionality. Look for PLC simulator software that offer realistic simulation of PLC inputs and outputs, timers, counters, memory bits, data blocks, and other PLC components. Some PLC simulator software also allow you to connect to external devices such as sensors, actuators, or HMI panels via serial, USB, or Ethernet ports.
- Check the quality. Read reviews and ratings from other users who have tried the PLC simulator software. Look for feedback on the ease of installation, user interface, performance, stability, accuracy, and support. Avoid PLC simulator software that have too many bugs, errors, or limitations.
- Check the availability. Make sure the PLC simulator software is still being updated and maintained by the developer. Some PLC simulator software may be outdated or discontinued and may not work properly with newer operating systems or PLC models.

By following these tips, you can find the best PLC simulator software free download full version that suits your learning objectives and budget. Some examples of popular and reliable PLC simulator software are:

- **LOGO! Software**: This is a free software from Siemens that allows you to create and simulate switching programs for LOGO! logic modules. You can use function diagram or ladder diagram to program your logic and test it online or offline. You can also connect to real LOGO! devices via Ethernet or USB[^1^].
- **MATLAB & Simulink**: This is a powerful software from MathWorks that allows you to design and simulate control systems using various tools and libraries. You can use Simulink to create graphical models of your control logic and connect them to MATLAB for data analysis and visualization. You can also interface with real PLCs via OPC or Modbus protocols[^2^].
- **TheWindowsClub**: This is a website that offers a list of free PLC simulation software for Windows PC. You can download and try different software such as PLCTrainer, LogixPro, PSIM, S7-PLCSIM, etc. Each software has its own features and advantages depending on your preference and skill level[^3^].
